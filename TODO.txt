HIGH PRIORITY:
-> showing something to Brian
-> rethink memory organization
-> split core (maybe if we understand c++ while doing so, we will manage to catch some bugs?)
-> debug shortcut model with stack size 1

LOWER_PRIOTITY:
-> add timers
-> add tests
-> add memory leak tests
-> add performance test
-> bash completion for gflags
-> cleaning up crazy python scripts living all over the place
-> rethink directory structure
-> tensors
