HIGH PRIORITY:
-> mshadow and tensors (mutli gpu support etc.)
-> add Mat.Slice

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
-> random weights init should take doubles, not template typename.
-> Improve NlpUtils. More generally agree on common set of practices for all the examples.
-> visualizer - web frontend for error visualization (60% done)
-> Move Redis visualizer example to tests with check for redis presence
-> switch "from unique words" in Vocab to "add_words"
-> improve numerical stability of Adadelta

LOWER_PRIOTITY:
-> add performance test
-> implement imagenet training
-> load existing image net model from caffe
-> make machine comprehension dataset inline with other loading system
-> made n-d print visually closer to numpy's n-d print
