-> visualizer - web frontend for error visualization (50% done)
-> Move Redis visualizer example to tests with check for redis presence
-> switch "from unique words" in Vocab to "add_words"
-> graceful connection / reconnection / deconnection in redox

LOWER_PRIOTITY:
-> add performance test
-> refactor masked entropy
-> sequence loss
-> implement imagenet training
-> load existing image net model from caffe
-> make machine comprehension dataset inline with other loading system
