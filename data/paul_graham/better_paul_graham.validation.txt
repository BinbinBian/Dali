For those contributing the MERS toolkit , I wanted to warn you of a pervasive change that
I changed the name of several pervasively used constants , to follow lisp convention ,

This affects
We deferred these changes to a quiet time , which I 've chosen to be mid summer .
Can you offer me your insights in the following ?
Dan and Szymon ,
Andrew , thanks for passing along .
What kind of quick analysis can you provide ?
P.S I 'll send out a separate email about clarifying the key selling features of each of your

That said , each day we see a large number of vehicles of different types operating in the water at the same time .
It would seem that our tools are poised to plan many of these missions .
At a basic level , our barrier is that we do n't yet have
Based on our experiences , we have set three demonstration objectives : to demonstrate1 ) a relevant core path planner for safe operation of the glider ,
This is our goal for the next couple days .
We have already seen that the spatial and temporal uncertainty is quite high when operating multiple vehicles ,
Global Constraints , ITC ( V1 , V2 ) , Probabilistic Scheduling , Resources .
I 'm continuing to push for the stretch goal of an OpSat for multi-vehicle planning with resources , in the hope
We are focussing on performing mission planning with the WHOI underwater glider .
All of these checkouts need to precede any tests with the planner .
Tomorrow ( Sunday for us ) we aspire to begin testing the mission planner , first in hardware in the loop simulation mode on the glider ,
I hope all is going well .
The plan for Szymon for this semester included implementing the
Szymon , I would appreciate an update on the milestones that have been achieved thus far ,
I would like to get you technical solutions written down , so we can review them more carefully ,
Please also arrange with Enrique to present this work at the group meeting in the next couple

As a comparison , the control field requires mastery of three subjects , the three I just listed .
The first two I believe are already known by most control students entering aero Astro .
