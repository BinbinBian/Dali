HIGH PRIORITY:
-> mutable_gpu_data should copy data from cpu vs. gpu if the operation is incremental
   else, only allocate since operation overwrites
-> mshadow and tensors (mutli gpu support etc.)
-> visualizer - web frontend for error visualization (60% done)
-> Move Redis visualizer example to tests with check for redis presence
-> switch "from unique words" in Vocab to "add_words"
-> graceful connection / reconnection / deconnection in redox
-> flatten folder structure (memory goes top level, mat / automatic diff in separate folder, layers (LSTM,GRU, etc..) in third folder)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
-> Improve NlpUtils. More generally agree on common set of practices for all the examples.
-> print method of TensorInternal must be n-dimensional aware

LOWER_PRIOTITY:
-> add performance test
-> refactor masked entropy
-> sequence loss
-> implement imagenet training
-> load existing image net model from caffe
-> make machine comprehension dataset inline with other loading system
